You need to implement all the methods that have inside their bodies the "//TODO" comment in each of the following three source code files:

CircularDoublyLinkedDeque.java, CircularLinkedQueue.java, and RecursionExercises.java. 

Read the comments in these three files carefully. 

Copy all the files in the templates folder hw04_Templates.zip into a package named edu.iastate.cs228.hw04.
