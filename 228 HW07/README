You need to implement all the methods and constructors in 

ResizableArrayBag, LinkedBag, and SearchingExercises classes with a comment in body "// TODO". 

In case of the latter there are only two methods that need to be implemented, however, 
note that there is a single question for each that needs to be answered after you finish implementing those. 

Answers need to be provided inside the comment where indicated. 

Regarding Big-Oh of these two methods, we do not require the best/fastest/most efficient implementation, 
but require that you are able to explain your own implementation's time complexity and provide Big-Oh representation of it.
